<p>Yes, this website!. Built using HTML, Javascript and CSS (along with a few libraries to ease the pain of boilerplate code) , with Hugo as the CMS and Forestry mixed in for a little GUI convenience, this is my little space on the internet.</p>
<h3 id="the-motivation">The Motivation</h3>
<p>Building, and maintaining a website was always pretty high up on the list of things I wanted to do, as it would’ve (and does) provide me with a place to write my thoughts, random tid-bits, tutorials (if I ever get to them) and what I learned along the way. Lastly and most importantly it also provides me with a place to showcase all the projects I devote my time to.</p>
<p>Also building a website is pretty cool, and rewarding, with a unique sense of accomplishment tied to it, as a website, in essence, represents the internet itself, and rightly so too, in my opinion, as it is of course how most information on the web is represented and communicated.</p>
<p>I actually stumbled onto Hugo, the CMS (<em>Content Management System</em>) and backbone of my site, completely by chance, while doing quick research to see how would I go about building a website (Hint: There are a lot, and I mean a <em>lot</em> of ways to do it, almost frustratingly many, and as it is with most code, almost no bad ways).</p>
<p>Reading up on Hugo’s excellent documentation, and searching about for a few use cases to get a proper feel for its capabilities and limitations, I decided to definitely use a static site generator for my site (of which Hugo is one), but to not settle on Hugo just yet.</p>
<p><em>Static site generators</em> seemed to fit my idea well, and provided bonuses in the form of faster build times and less demanding server requirements, things I hadn’t even originally factored into what I had wanted to make.</p>
<p>After diving a bit more into the topic, I found that with Hugo, I had, by chance, found out the exact fit for my site!</p>
<p>I had wanted to put off building this site until I actually had stuff I could <em>put</em> here, but, using greatly built software, which I was beginning to see more and more Hugo definitely was, is one of my greatest weaknesses, and the absolute joy I knew I would feel working with software that was such greatly designed proved to be too great a temptation, and here we are, with a mostly built site, hosted on GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>Hugo has, as I correctly guessed, been an absolute joy to work with, and even though I had learned some HTML, CSS and Javascript before beginning to be able to build it faster, I must say it was far easier and painless than I had been expecting, and the plethora of online tutorials out there (as there <em>always</em> are) proved once more to be especially invaluable, especially Mike Dane’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&amp;list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3"><em>Getting Started With Hugo</em></a> series on YouTube, which helped me out greatly.</p>
<p>Forestry was also something I discovered by chance, and wasn’t quite sure I  would end up using, but after checking it out some more, I decided to use it too, to reduce the slight inconvenience of having to involve a CLI (<em>Command Line Interface</em>) whenever I wanted to make another post.</p>
<p>That and it was clearly very elegantly and thoughtfully crafted, so how could I resist ?</p>
<p>For the animations and (minimal) logic associated with my site, I tried my hand at CSS and Javascript, both for the first time, and while I was completely new to them, I found, as I had been told by numerous sources on the internet, that the first language is always the hardest. Truly understanding the concepts and logical flow of one makes the transition to another comparatively easier.</p>
<p>Regardless, after about 2 days of playing around with CSS and Javascript, I had gotten a grasp on the fundamentals, and had some basic animations ready to go, and all that was left was to configure the hosting, and build it up and launch it  <del>across</del> , pardon me, <em>on</em> the internet.</p>
<p>My other projects until now, most  still in various stages of development, have all been mostly offline, and I’ve avoided the web to the best of my ability, frightened by the complexity and intricacies it no doubt housed (read: Red lines of fatal errors I would have no idea where to even begin to solve), but it was something new to try, a previously unexplored part of the world of the internet (for me), and while I knew it would not be easy, and most definitely frustrating at times, (as it sometimes was), if coding for the past 4 years has taught me anything by now, its that we should not be afraid to jump into the unknown, the unexplored, or the possibly very frustrating, not regardless , but <em>despite</em> of the problems and frustration we know we will face.</p>
<p>Now, with a little bit of experience under my belt, and having clearly made it to the other side of this project, I understand how it may seem like I’m telling you to jump of a cliff based on a promise that its not actually as high as it looks, but I cannot reiterate the importance of learning and exploring new things, of jumping off the proverbial cliff, <strong>of not being afraid to fail, but rather embracing it as a part of the learning process</strong>.</p>
<p>It is our instinct as humans to be afraid of that which we don’t know, and to get attached to what we <em>do</em> know, what we no doubt have spent huge amounts of time and effort into learning, but in doing so we often forget that there is a world out there, waiting for us, a world full of possibilities, endless possibilities, each <em>one</em> having the power to change the course of our lives forever, and each one but a grasp away, if only we have the courage, and the trust in ourselves, to <strong><em>jump</em></strong>.</p>
