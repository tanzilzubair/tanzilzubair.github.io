        <div class="content"><h2 id="this-website">This Website!</h2>
<p>Yes, this website!. Built using HTML, Javascript and CSS (along with libraries to ease the pain of boilerplate code) , with <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> as the CMS and <a href="https://forestry.io">Forestry</a> mixed in for a little GUI convenience, this is my little space on the internet.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-motivation">The Motivation</h2>
<p>Building, and maintaining a website was always pretty high up on the list of things I wanted to do, as it would’ve (and does) provide me with a place to write my thoughts, random tid-bits, tutorials (if I ever get to them) and what I learned along the way. Most importantly it also provides me with a place to showcase all the projects I devote my time to.</p>
<p>Also building a website is pretty cool, and rewarding, with a unique sense of accomplishment tied to it, as a website, in essence, represents the internet itself, and rightly so too, in my opinion, as it is of course how most information on the web is represented and communicated.</p>
<h2 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h2>
<p>I actually stumbled onto Hugo, the CMS (<em>Content Management System</em>) and backbone of my site, completely by chance, while doing quick research to see how would I go about building a website (Hint: There are a lot, and I mean a <em>lot</em> of ways to do it, almost frustratingly many, and as it is with most code, almost no &ldquo;bad&rdquo; ways).</p>
<p>Reading up on Hugo’s excellent documentation, and searching about for a few use cases to get a proper feel for its capabilities and limitations, I decided to definitely use a static site generator for my site (of which Hugo is one), but to not settle on Hugo just yet.</p>
<p><em>Static site generators</em> seemed to fit my idea well, and provided bonuses in the form of faster build times and less demanding server requirements, things I hadn’t even originally factored into what I had wanted to make.</p>
<p>After diving a bit more into the topic, I found that with Hugo, I had, by chance, found out the exact fit for my site!</p>
<p>I had wanted to put off building this site until I actually had stuff I could <em>put</em> here, but, using greatly built software, which I was beginning to see more and more Hugo definitely was, is one of my greatest weaknesses, and the sheer amount of fun I knew working with software that was such greatly designed is proved to be too great a temptation, and here we are, with a V1 site, hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-complexity">The Complexity</h2>
<p>The pages on the site are generated by Hugo from custom-built layouts made with HTML, CSS and JS, the legendary trio. While HTML and CSS seem easy enough from the outside looking in, and are in all honesty easy enough to start out with, I learned they can quickly get quite complex.</p>
<p>This was also the first time I experienced what felt, to me at least, coding blind, with no <em>Intellisense</em>, auto-complete or even code formatting ( I know about <a href="https://prettier.io"><em>Prettier</em></a>, but due to complex compatibly issues that I couldn&rsquo;t quite figure out the cause for, I couldn&rsquo;t use it without runtime errors ) to guide and aid me, and so the first few days were quite rough.</p>
<p>This first version of my site is also quite basic, with minimal animations and nearly no logic, as I am new to all of the three languages my site is written in.</p>
<p>Especially with JS, coming from <a href="https://dart.dev" title="Dart">Dart</a>, which was my first language, and one that is type safe (a feature I have come to depend on and prefer to its counterpart) , parts of JS seemed convoluted and weird, and, facing down a long list of easily preventable ( had I had Intellisense or static type checking ) flashing errors, I alternated between contemplating giving up and bashing JS quite a bit, the first few days, before slowly getting used to this new set of tools dropped before me.</p>
<p>Regardless, after the first few days of <del>repeatedly and furiously bashing my head against it and more Stack Overflow combing than I&rsquo;d care to admit</del> err <em>practicing</em> with it, I had come to appreciate it for its differences, and while I missed the things I had come to rely on with Dart, I had found most of their counterparts, or developed workarounds, slowly progressing towards the logic I required from my site.</p>
<p>One thing that I came to understand, and that helped me out greatly was the realization that due to its long history ( <em>far</em> longer than Dart ) if there was functionality I could dream up, there was an open-sourced JS library out there providing it.</p>
<p>JS may have had its cons with being a much older and as such, much more burdened language than Dart, built with the ideals of a different time, but this was a game-changing thing, one that would end up saving me huge amounts of time and frustration ( which, to be honest, was still enough to go around ).</p>
<p><a href="pub.dev" title="Pub.dev">Pub.dev</a>, the default and I believe sole package manager for Dart was great, more than great in fact, but it was in its infancy compared to the JS ecosystem, which had had time for packages to be made, mature, die out and be replaced by better alternatives, <em>over and over again</em> till what was left was quality, and a <em>lot</em> of packages for everything under the sun.</p>
<p>As for HTML and CSS, they were pretty straightforward, but deceptively deep in terms of nuances and what you could do with them, but, in my opinion, quite lenient in terms of what code was acceptable, even more so in terms of what wasn&rsquo;t a runtime error altogether.</p>
<p>I realize this sentiment was accentuated by my minimal experience, that too with only one language, which resulted in me drawing comparisons to it regardless of how much I tried not to, and disregarding parts that didn&rsquo;t match with <em>its</em> style, but still, did there <em>really</em> need to be <em>that</em> much leniency ?</p>
<p>Funnily enough, through my search for more strict ( and hence, in my opinion, safer, and more maintainable ) ways to write HTML, CSS and JS, I stumbled upon Rust, what I&rsquo;ve heard called a very type safe, strict language that is accompanied by an even stricter compiler that allows very few if any errors through.</p>
<p>It also happens to be low level enough to write <em>kernels</em> in, with an open source project out there making a whole entire operating system with it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t currently have any projects in the pipeline that could really benefit from its speed, or its general area of expertise ( its a <em>systems</em> programming language ) , but its been rated Stack Overflow&rsquo;s most loved language 5 times <em>in a row</em>, and it just happens to also encourage the style of code that I most love writing, so I&rsquo;ll probably find a way to sneak it in <em>somewhere</em>.</p>
<p>Regardless, after about about a week of messing around with these 3 languages, I had gotten a grasp on the very basics, and most importantly, could start to accurately predict what the code I had written would end up actually producing on the screen, which was a key milestone.</p>
<p>I had some basic animations and most of the (minimal) logic needed ready to go by this point, and all that was left was to configure the hosting, and build it up and <del>yeet</del> pardon me, <em>launch</em> it onto the internet.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The End</h2>
<p>Hugo has, as I correctly guessed, been an absolute joy to work with, HTML, CSS and JS a bit less so, but the plethora of online tutorials out there (as there <em>always</em> are) proved once more to be especially invaluable, especially Mike Dane’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&amp;list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3"><em>Getting Started With Hugo</em></a> series on YouTube, which helped me out greatly with setting up and configuring the CMS, and a whole army&rsquo;s worth of channels which had videos for everything from hour long overviews of the trio of languages to 5 minute bite-sized videos showing how to make the near <em>exact</em> feature I wanted in my website.</p>
<p>Again, a welcome pro from these languages having existed for so much longer than anything else I&rsquo;ve used till now.</p>
<p>Forestry was also something I discovered by chance, and wasn’t quite sure I  would end up using, but after checking it out some more, I decided to use it too, to reduce the slight inconvenience of having to involve a CLI (<em>Command Line Interface</em>) whenever I wanted to make another post.</p>
<p>That and it was clearly very elegantly and thoughtfully crafted, so how could I resist ?</p>
<h2 id="perpetual-improvement">Perpetual Improvement</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not done with the website yet, nowhere near it actually. I plan to add many more animations, provide proper responsiveness for smaller devices, actually have good-looking typography, add a host of other features, and finally, optimize as much of all of this as I can.</p>
<p>My first few projects taught me the importance of having a plan before starting, and to have a relative idea of where and how all the pieces fit together at all times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already roughly sketched out the path I&rsquo;m going to take, with there most likely being 4 - 5 versions of this site before I&rsquo;m done with mostly everything I want this site to be capable of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Psst</em></strong> It&rsquo;s Tanzil from the future, here to let you know that version 2 of the site is already up, and if you&rsquo;re reading this, you&rsquo;re already on it! You can check out the post about it <strong><em>here</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-fear">The Fear</h2>
<p>My other projects until now, most still in various stages of development as of writing this, have all been mostly offline, and I’ve avoided networking or web code to the best of my ability, frightened by the complexity and intricacies it no doubt housed (read: Red lines of fatal errors I would have no idea where to even begin to solve), but it was something new to try, a previously unexplored part of the world of the internet for me, and while I knew it would not be easy, and most definitely frustrating at times, , if coding for the past 4 years has taught me anything by now, its that we should not be afraid to jump into the unknown, the unexplored, or the possibly very frustrating, not regardless, but <em>despite</em> of the problems and frustration we know we will face.</p>
<p>Now, with a little bit of experience under my belt, and having clearly made it to the other side of this project, I understand how it may seem like I’m telling you to jump of a cliff based on a promise that its not actually as high as it looks, but I cannot reiterate the importance of learning and exploring new things, of jumping off the proverbial cliff, <strong>of not being afraid to fail, but rather embracing it as a part of the learning process</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-courage">The Courage</h2>
<p>It is our instinct as humans to be afraid of that which we don’t know, and to get attached to what we <em>do</em> know, what we no doubt have spent huge amounts of time and effort into learning, but in doing so we often forget that there is a world out there, waiting for us, a world full of possibilities, <em>endless</em> possibilities, each <em>one</em> having the power to change the course of our lives forever, and each one but a grasp away, if only we have the courage, and the trust in ourselves, to <strong><em>jump</em></strong>.</p>
